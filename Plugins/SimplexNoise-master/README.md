* This is a clean, fast, modern and free Perlin Simplex noise function.
* If we change float to double it could be even faster but there is no double type in Blueprint
* All Public Functions are BlueprintCallable so they can be used in every blueprint

This algorithm was originally designed by Ken Perlin, but my code has been
adapted and extended from the implementation written by Stefan Gustavson (stegu@itn.liu.se)
and modified to fit to Unreal Engine 4
